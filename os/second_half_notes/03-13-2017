@title - Address binding
@def address binding - where to find memory object
* symbolic [x]-> relocatable [x + 24] -> Absolute [0xFFFFFFFFFFFFF]
* windows -> dynamically linked libraries (dll)
* linux -> Shared Libs
* Real-physical memory mean RAM
* Real memory can be broken into fixed partition and variable partition schemes
* Virtual memory can be broken into paged, segmented and combination paged, segmented
* |OS |||| User|  |||| = fence register
@def fence register - A register that serves as a protective barrier between segments of memory
@list - Assumptions about memory
  1. Limited amount of memory
  2. Instructions/data in memory (addresses)
  3. Process is contiguous in memory
  4. Entire process is in memory
@def fixed partitions - memory is partitioned into a fixed # of fixed-size regions
* only 1 process per partition
* scheduling
* Internal fragmentation (memory wasted inside partition)
